# dp-playerbot
Inspired by one request at DarkPurple's discord server, I coded a simple bot for the folks at DarkPurple's Staff 

# Usage
By changing the token you should be done.
The default prefix is "!", but you can change it in the script
The command "players" will give the number of players on
The command "list" will give a list of every player who is on.

# Requirements
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
[mcstatus](https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus)
